            Hi there! My name is Sean Lambert. I am currently on my journey to become a .NET developer as part of Grand Circus's boot camp!
        </p>
        <p>
            So far, we've learned about C#, .NET Core, HTML, CSS, SQL, and we just started ASP.NET. I am excited to continue learning more and more about how to code/develop and to start my career.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now I live in Clarkston, Michigan, but I grew up in Shelby Township, Michigan. They are both nice towns to live in, with a lot of lakes, forests, and parks around both areas. I grew up a mile down the road from Stony Creek Metropark and I have many great memories there.
